I'm a junior cybersecurity student at Western Governors University with a strong passion for system defense, threat analysis, and building secure environments.

## Objective

As a aspiring cybersecurity professional focused on Security Operations Center (SOC) and incident response roles. I‚Äôm actively building hands-on experience through lab environments that simulate real-world scenarios, including log analysis, threat detection, and mitigation techniques. My goal is to apply and expand my knowledge in identifying, analyzing, and responding to security events that may impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems. I aim to contribute to an enterprise-level security team by leveraging my growing skills in event triage, alert correlation, and use of ticketing systems to document and escalate incidents in accordance with standard response frameworks like CSIRC. Eager to support a mission-driven team as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst or Information Security Analyst.
